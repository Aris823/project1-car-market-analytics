You can find a general dashboard. On the Left, we have a table showing how many cars we have based on car brand and their total value in Baht.
On the Right, we have a pie chart showing the proportions of each car brand.

You can also filter/search by car brand in the search box.

Or you can click the legend to remove the car brand you are not interested in. Therefore, leaving only those you are interesting in.
